palindromes
===========

Script(s) to find palindromic substrings of a given string. The script implements three approaches:

* iterative, by comparing character by character in a substring of all possible lengths
* recursive, by comparing character-by-character in a substring of all possible lengths
* by cutting a substring in half and comparing the first half to the reverse of the second half (method suggested by a friend who did [his own implementation in Node.js](http://github.com/spikesagal/palindrome "SpikeSagal - Palindrome")).

Usage instructions for the script can be found by running `php palindromes.php --help`
